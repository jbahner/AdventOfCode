# AdventOfCode

Project containing my solutions to the yearly [AdventOfCode event](https://adventofcode.com/).  
Please note that I do these challenges for entertainment purposes only. None of the code is meant to be perfect,
I just love to learn new things, try out new features and experiment with different (possibly over-engineered) approaches.
